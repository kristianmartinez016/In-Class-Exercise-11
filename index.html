        <h1>Belling the Cat</h1>
        <h2>Cherry Bomb One and Fuzzy Bubbles</h2>
          <p>
            The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of the enemy, the Cat.
            At least they wished to find some way of knowing when she was coming, so they might have time 
            to run away. Indeed, something had to be done, for they lived in such constant fear of her claws 
            that they hardly dared stir from their dens by night or day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good enough. At last a young Mouse got up 
            and said:
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>"I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be successful.<br> All we have to do 
            is hang a bell around the Cat's neck. When we hear the bell ringing we will know immediately that 
            our enemy is coming."</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            All the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of such a plan before. But in the midst 
            of rejoicing over their good fortune, an old Mouse arose and said:
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>"I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good. But let me ask one question. Who will 
            bell the Cat?"</i>
          </p>
